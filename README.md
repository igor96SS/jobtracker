# Job Applications Manager
An Android application to manage job applications in a practical and intuitive way.

## Functionalities
- List all job applications  
- Add and edit applications  
- View detailed information about each application  
- Update the status of applications  
- Delete applications with confirmation

## Motivation
This project was born from a personal need to keep track of job applications in a simpler and cleaner way.  
I wanted something less tedious than constantly updating a `.txt` file, so I took the opportunity to put my skills into practice — while also creating a new project for my portfolio.

## Challenges Faced
Although this is a relatively simple app, I decided to challenge myself by learning and applying the **MVVM architecture**.  
At this point, I’ve managed to connect the UI and Room database using ViewModels. However, I recognize that the app is not yet fully MVVM — especially in terms of UI logic and form validation, which are still partly handled in the Activity.

Still, this project has been a great learning experience and helped me understand how to better separate concerns in Android development.

## How to Install

The app is available on the **Google Play Store**.
